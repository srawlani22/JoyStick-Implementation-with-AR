# JoyStick-Implementation-with-AR

This is a really the one of my most cool and quick AR projects. Being a Dragon Ball fan, I used a dragon ball character and 
tried to move it around a target that was designed using Vuforia(an AR development kit). The 3d model for the character 
can be found online for free and also in this repo.

The virtual character can be moved accross the target using the joyStick that is implemented. The joyStick works in 360 degree
environment, which means that character can be moved in three directions using the joystick. The further steps in this 
project would be to add other buttons like jump and slide, and also add some more obstacles, health bar/number of lives, 
and different levels.

PS: I would love if someone would be super intrested in working further on this project.
